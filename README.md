# RobloxBrowser2.0
Remake of the application ROBLOX used to have for browsing the ROBLOX website, which was available until 2012 (Here's some info about it: https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/ROBLOX_Browser). Use with Dark Theme (Light Theme version coming soon).
Made using Visual Studio. Requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 and
 have fun, i guess.
