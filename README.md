# This doesn't work anymore!
This program broke when Roblox discontinued Internet Explorer support. This program will not be fixed and will be left in a broken state.
Everything below this sentence is leftovers from the old README.

## This now probably doesn't work!
Roblox now no longer supports the built-in browser (Internet Explorer), so it may be impossible to use this at the moment. RIP.

## RobloxBrowser2.0
Remake of the application ROBLOX used to have for browsing the ROBLOX website, which was available until 2012 (Here's some info about it: https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/ROBLOX_Browser). Use with Dark Theme (Light Theme version coming soon).
Made using Visual Studio. Requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 and have fun, i guess.
